;;; Commentary:
;;
;; org-board uses `org-attach' and `wget' to provide a bookmarking and
;; web archival system  directly from an Org file.   Any `wget' switch
;; can be used  in `org-board', and presets (like user  agents) can be
;; set for easier  control.  Every snapshot is logged and  saved to an
;; automatically generated folder, and snapshots for the same link can
;; be compared using the `ztree' package (optional dependency; `ediff'
;; used if `zdiff' is not available).  Arbitrary functions can also be
;; run after an archive, allowing for extensive user customization.

;;; Documentation:
;;
;;;; * Motivation
;;
;;  org-board is a bookmarking and web archival system for Emacs Org
;;  mode, building on ideas from Pinboard <https://pinboard.in>.  It
;;  archives your bookmarks so that you can access them even when
;;  you're not online, or when the site hosting them goes down.
;;  `wget' is used as a backend for archival, so any of its options
;;  can be used directly from org-board.  This means you can download
;;  whole sites for archival with a couple of keystrokes, while
;;  keeping track of your archives from a simple Org file.
;;
;;;; * Summary
;;
;;  In org-board, a bookmark is represented by an Org heading of any
;;  level, with a `URL' property containing one or more URLs.  Once
;;  such a heading is created, a call to `org-board-archive' creates a
;;  unique ID and directory for the entry via `org-attach', archives
;;  the contents and requisites of the page(s) listed in the `URL'
;;  property using `wget', and saves them inside the entry's
;;  directory.  A link to the (timestamped) root archive folder is
;;  created in the property `ARCHIVED_AT'.  Multiple archives can be
;;  made for each entry.  Additional options to pass to `wget' can be
;;  specified via the property `WGET_OPTIONS'.  The variable
;;  `org-board-after-archive-functions' (defaulting to nil) holds a
;;  list of functions to run after each archival operation.
;;
;;;; * User commands
;;
;;  `org-board-archive' archives the current entry, creating a unique
;;    ID and directory via `org-attach' if necessary.
;;
;;  `org-board-archive-dry-run' shows the `wget' invocation that will
;;    run for this entry in the echo area.
;;
;;  `org-board-new' prompts for a URL to add to the current entry's
;;    properties, then archives the entry immediately.
;;
;;  `org-board-delete-all' deletes all the archives for this entry by
;;    deleting the `org-attach' directory.
;;
;;  `org-board-open' opens the bookmark at point in a browser.
;;    Default to the built-in browser, `eww', and with prefix, the
;;    native operating system browser.
;;
;;  `org-board-diff' uses `zdiff' (if available) or `ediff' to
;;    recursively diff two archives of the same entry.
;;
;;  `org-board-diff3' uses `ediff' to recursively diff three archives
;;    of the same entry.
;;
;;  `org-board-cancel' cancels the current org-board archival process.
;;
;;  `org-board-run-after-archive-function' prompts for a function and
;;    an archive in the current entry, and applies the function to the
;;    archive.
;;
;;  These are all bound in the `org-board-keymap' variable (not bound
;;  to any key by default).
;;
;;;; * Customizable options
;;
;;  `org-board-wget-program' is the path to the wget program.
;;
;;  `org-board-wget-switches' are the command line options to use with
;;  `wget'.  By default these are included as:
;;
;;    "-e robots=off"      ignores robots.txt files.
;;    "--page-requisites"  downloads all page requisites (CSS, images).
;;    "--adjust-extension" add a ".html" extension where needed.
;;    "--convert-links"    convert external links to internal.
;;
;;  `org-board-agent-header-alist' is an alist mapping agent names to
;;  their respective header/user-agent arguments.  Set a
;;  `WGET_OPTIONS' property to a key of this alist (say,
;;  `Mac-OS-10.8') and org-board will replace the key with its
;;  corresponding value before calling wget.  This is useful for some
;;  sites that refuse to serve pages to `wget'.
;;
;;  `org-board-wget-show-buffer' controls whether the archival process
;;  buffer is shown in a window (defaults to true).
;;
;;  `org-board-log-wget-invocation' controls whether to log the
;;  archival process command in the root of the archival directory
;;  (defaults to true).
;;
;;  `org-board-domain-regexp-alist' applies certain options when a
;;  domain matches a regular expression.  See the docstring for
;;  details.  As an example, this is used to make sure that `wget'
;;  does not send a User Agent string when archiving from Google
;;  Cache, which will not normally serve pages to it.
;;
;;  `org-board-after-archive-functions' (default nil) holds a list of
;;  functions to run after an archival takes place.  This is intended
;;  for user extensions to `org-board'.  The functions receive three
;;  arguments: a list of URLs downloaded, the folder name where they
;;  were downloaded and the process filter event string (see the Elisp
;;  manual for details on the possible values of this string).  For an
;;  example use of `org-board-after-archive-functions', see the
;;  "Example usage" section below.
;;
;;  `org-board-make-relative' (default nil) makes the stored link in
;;  mode to be relative to the org file holding it.
;;
;;;; * Known limitations
;;
;;  Options like "--header: 'Agent X" cannot be specified as
;;  properties, because the property API splits on spaces, and such an
;;  option has to be passed to `wget' as one argument.  To work around
;;  this, add these types of options to `org-board-agent-header-alist'
;;  instead, where the property API is not involved.
;;
;;  At the moment, only one archive can be done at a time.
;;
;;;; * Example usage
;;
;;;;; ** Archiving
;;
;;  I recently found a list of articles on linkers that I wanted to
;;  bookmark and keep locally for offline reading.  In a dedicated org
;;  file for bookmarks I created this entry:
;;
;;  ** TODO Linkers (20-part series)
;;  :PROPERTIES:
;;  :URL:          http://a3f.at/lists/linkers
;;  :WGET_OPTIONS: --recursive -l 1 --span-hosts
;;  :END:
;;
;;  Where the `URL' property is a page that already lists the URLs
;;  that I wanted to download.  I specified the recursive property for
;;  `wget' along with a depth of 1 ("-l 1") so that each linked page
;;  would be downloaded.  With point inside the entry, I run "M-x
;;  org-board-archive".  An `org-attach' directory is created and
;;  `wget' starts downloading the pages to it.  Afterwards, the end
;;  the entry looks like this:
;;
;;  ** TODO Linkers (20-part series)
;;  :PROPERTIES:
;;  :URL:          http://a3f.at/lists/linkers
;;  :WGET_OPTIONS: --recursive -l 1 --span-hosts
;;  :ID:           D3BCE79F-C465-45D5-847E-7733684B9812
;;  :ARCHIVED_AT:  [2016-08-30-Tue-15-03-56]
;;  :END:
;;
;;  The value in the `ARCHIVED_AT' property is a link that points to
;;  the root of the timestamped archival directory.  The ID property
;;  was automatically generated by `org-attach'.
;;
;;;;; ** Diffing
;;
;;  You can diff between two archives done for the same entry using
;;  `org-board-diff', so you can see how a page has changed over time.
;;  The diff recurses through the directory structure of an archive
;;  and will highlight any changes that have been made.  `ediff' is
;;  used if `zdiff' is not available (both are capable of recursing
;;  through a directory structure, but `zdiff' is possibly more
;;  intuitive to use).  `org-board-diff3' also offers diffing between
;;  three different archive directories.
;;
;;;;; ** `org-board-after-archive-functions'
;;
;;  `org-board-after-archive-functions' is a list of functions run
;;  after an archive is finished.  You can use it to do anything you
;;  like with newly archived pages.  For example, you could add a
;;  function that copies the new archive to an external hard disk, or
;;  opens the archived page in your browser as soon as it is done
;;  downloading.  You could also, for instance, copy all of the media
;;  files that were downloaded to your own media folder, and pop up a
;;  Dired buffer inside that folder to give you the chance to
;;  organize them.
;;
;;  Here is an example function that copies the archived page to an
;;  external service called `IPFS' <http://ipfs.io/>, a decentralized
;;  versioning and storage system geared towards web content (thanks
;;  to Alan Schmitt):
;;
;;  (defun org-board-add-to-ipfs (urls output-folder event &rest _rest)
;;    "Add the downloaded site to IPFS."
;;    (unless (string-match "exited abnormally" event)
;;      (let* ((parsed-url (url-generic-parse-url (car urls)))
;;             (domain (url-host parsed-url))
;;             (path (url-filename parsed-url))
;;             (output (shell-command-to-string
;;                   (concat "ipfs add -r "
;;                           (concat output-folder domain))))
;;             (ipref
;;           (nth 1 (split-string
;;                   (car (last (split-string output "\n" t))) " "))))
;;        (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create "*org-board-post-archive*")
;;          (princ (format "your file is at %s\n"
;;                      (concat "http://localhost:8080/ipfs/" ipref path))
;;              (current-buffer))))))
;;
;;  (eval-after-load "org-board"
;;    '(add-hook 'org-board-after-archive-functions 'org-board-add-to-ipfs))
;;
;;  Note that for forward compatibility, it's best to add to a final
;;  `&rest' argument to every function listed in
;;  `org-board-after-archive-functions', since a future update may
;;  provide each function with additional arguments (like a marker
;;  pointing to a buffer position where the archive was initiated, for
;;  example).
;;
;;  For more information on `org-board-after-archive-functions', see
;;  its docstring and the docstring of
;;  `org-board-test-after-archive-function'.
;;
;;  You can also interactively run an after-archive function with the
;;  command `org-board-run-after-archive-function'.  See its docstring
;;  for details.
;;
;;;;
;;;; * Getting started
;;
;;;;; ** Installation
;;
;;  There are two ways to install the package.  One way is to clone
;;  this repository and add the directory to your load-path manually.
;;
;;  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/org-board")
;;  (require 'org-board)
;;
;;  Alternatively, you can download the package directly from Emacs
;;  using MELPA <https://github.com/melpa/melpa>.  M-x
;;  package-install RET org-board RET will take care of it.
;;
;;;; ** Keybindings
;;
;;  The following keymap is defined in `org-board-keymap':
;;
;;  | Key | Command                              |
;;  | a   | org-board-archive                    |
;;  | r   | org-board-archive-dry-run            |
;;  | n   | org-board-new                        |
;;  | k   | org-board-delete-all                 |
;;  | o   | org-board-open                       |
;;  | d   | org-board-diff                       |
;;  | 3   | org-board-diff3                      |
;;  | c   | org-board-cancel                     |
;;  | x   | org-board-run-after-archive-function |
;;  | O   | org-attach-reveal-in-emacs           |
;;  | ?   | Show help for this keymap.           |
;;
;;  To install the keymap give it a prefix key, e.g.:
;;
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") org-board-keymap)
;;
;;  Then typing `C-c o a' would run `org-board-archive', for example.
;;
;;;; * Miscellaneous
;;
;;  The location of `wget' should be picked up automatically from the
;;  `PATH' environment variable.  If it is not, then the variable
;;  `org-board-wget-program' can be customized.
;;
;;  Other options are already set so that archiving bookmarks is done
;;  pretty much automatically.  With no `WGET_OPTIONS' specified, by
;;  default `org-board-archive' will just download the page and its
;;  requisites (images and CSS), and nothing else.
;;
;;;;; ** Support for org-capture from Firefox (thanks to Alan Schmitt):
;;
;;  On the Firefox side, install org-capture from here:
;;
;;    http://chadok.info/firefox-org-capture/
;;
;;  Alternatively, you can do it manually by following the
;;  instructions here:
;;
;;    http://weblog.zamazal.org/org-mode-firefox/
;;      (in the “The advanced way” section)
;;
;;  When org-capture is installed, add `(require 'org-protocol)' to
;;  your init file (`~/.emacs').
;;
;;  Then create a capture template like this:
;;
;;    (setq org-board-capture-file "my-org-board.org")
;;
;;    (setq org-capture-templates
;;          `(...
;;            ("c" "capture through org protocol" entry
;;              (file+headline ,org-board-capture-file "Unsorted")
;;              "* %?%:description\n:PROPERTIES:\n:URL: %:link\n:END:\n\n Added %U")
;;            ...))
;;
;;  And add a hook to `org-capture-before-finalize-hook':
;;
;;    (defun do-org-board-dl-hook ()
;;      (when (equal (buffer-name)
;;              (concat "CAPTURE-" org-board-capture-file))
;;        (org-board-archive)))
;;
;;    (add-hook 'org-capture-before-finalize-hook 'do-org-board-dl-hook)
;;
;;;; * Acknowledgements
;;
;;  Thanks to Alan Schmitt for the code to combine `org-board' and
;;  `org-capture', and for the example function used in the
;;  documentation of `org-board-after-archive-functions' above.
